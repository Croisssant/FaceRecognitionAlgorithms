## About
This repository consist of the crictical evaluation and comparison of a deep learning algorithm and a non-deep learning algorithm in face recognition. The deep learning method uses a well known CNN, VGG-FACE, while the non-deep learning method uses Viola-Jones for face detection and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction. Further information and citation can be found in the code and "AlgorithmsEvaluationReport.pdf".

## The deep learning model (VGG-FACE) can be found here:
